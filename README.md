# Prophet
This repository serves as a backup of my collabrative work with [Gridsum Holding Inc.](https://www.gridsum.com/) on Prophet, a closed-source, large-scale data and machine learning platform that has been adopted by multiple companies across various industries, ranging from oil to manufacturing. The platform includes several patented and confidential features, as requested by clients, and therefore, the codebase cannot be shared publicly. After consultation and discussions with the development team, I have been granted permission to present some of my work logs and examples of my programming efforts, with sensitive information blurred.
